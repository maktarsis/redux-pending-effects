# Redux Pending Effects

ðŸ¦‹ A redux toolkit that tracks your asynchronous [redux](http://redux.js.org) [actions](https://redux.js.org/basics/actions) (effects) and informs about the pending state using the selector function
<br/>

List of supported libraries that process redux effects:

- [redux-toolkit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit)
- [redux-saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga)
- [redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) / [redux-promise-middleware](https://github.com/pburtchaell/redux-promise-middleware)

It's worth mention that `redux-pending-effects` allows you to code simultaneously with all libraries above.

<br/>

## Problem it solves

Have you ever been in a situation where you need to add a global loader/spinner to any side effect that your application is processing? Perhaps you are using Redux and some third-party library for asynchronous processing, for example, redux-saga / redux-thunk / promise middleware? Great, then it should be interesting to you.

Why not handle the pending state manually for each action?

- It is very unpleasant to create separately for this state and add start and end actions for these actions to each request.
- This is an open place to make mistakes because it's very easy to forget to add or remove these actions.
- It needs to be supported and somehow live with it.

Well, `redux-pending-effects` does this from scratch:

- tracks your asynchronous code
- collects them in a bunch
- efficiently calculates active pending effects
- provides a selector for information about the current state of application loading
- available for debugging in redux-devtools
- independent of a particular asynchronous processing solution. Can be used simultaneously with `redux-saga` and `redux-toolkit`
- replaces `redux-thunk` in the matters of side effects (not actions chaining) and `redux-promise-middleware` (essentially uses it out of the box)

## Quickstart

### Installation

```shell script
npm install redux-pending-effects
```

### Extend reducers

`redux-pending-effects` provides its own state for storing active effects (pending promise phase).

```javascript
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { insertPending } from 'redux-pending-effects';

import { planetReducer as planet } from './planetReducer';
import { universeReducer as universe } from './universeReducer';

export const rootReducer = combineReducers(
  insertPending({
    planet,
    universe
  })
);
```

### Configuration

It depends on which side effect processing libraries you use. Now let's dwell on this in more detail.

- ### [redux-toolkit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit)

This approach is the most straightforward and clear. Just add the middleware and use your regular toolkit async actions as usual.

```javascript
import { configureStore, getDefaultMiddleware } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import { toolkitMiddleware } from 'redux-pending-effects';
import { rootReducer as reducer } from './root.reducer';

const defaultMiddlewares = getDefaultMiddleware();
const middleware = [toolkitMiddleware, ...defaultMiddlewares];

export const store = configureStore({ reducer, middleware });
```

- ### [redux-saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga)

If your project uses `redux-saga`, then no additional configuration needed.

This approach is that you need to wrap the saga worker.
It allows us to track the start and the completion phase of each effect.

```javascript
import { trackWorker } from 'redux-pending-effects';
import { call, put, takeEvery } from '@redux-saga/core/effects';

function* getPlanets() {
  yield takeEvery(getPlanetsRequest.type, trackWorker(handleGetPlanets));
}

function* handleGetPlanets() {
  const planets = yield call(Api.getPlanets);
  yield put(getPlanetsCompleted(planets));
}
```

This approach successfully combined with custom wrappers on top of the worker, for example, error handling.

```javascript
const workerWrapper = worker => {
  return trackWorker(customWrapper);

  function* customWrapper(...args) {
    try {
      yield* worker(...args);
    } catch (error) {
      yield put(setFetchError(error));
    }
  }
};
```

- ### [redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) / [redux-promise-middleware](https://github.com/pburtchaell/redux-promise-middleware)

Ok, here I need to explain the problem a bit.

It's not entirely true this package supports `redux-thunk`, but the truth is that you can forward promises to the payload.
That is the way `redux-promise-middleware` does. At the moment, this library completely replaces `redux-promise-middleware`.
In the plans, through the collaboration, expand the API of `redux-promise-middleware` to reuse their internal API.

For details, you can go to read the documentation of `redux-promise-middleware` about how this works.

In short, everything is quite simple.
You pass promise value as payload, and we will have stateful types inside the reducer.
Let's say we have action type `GET_PLANETS`, so when we call our action with a type and a promise in the payload, it first triggers a reducer with `GET_PLANETS_PENDING`.
Then, when our promise resolved, we will have `GET_PLANETS_FULFILLED` type and value of resolved promise as a payload inside reducer.
But, if an error occurs in our promise, then we get the type `GET_PLANETS_REJECTED` with a reason within property payload.

```javascript
import { configureStore, getDefaultMiddleware } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import { promiseMiddleware } from 'redux-pending-effects';
import { rootReducer as reducer } from './root.reducer';

const defaultMiddlewares = getDefaultMiddleware();
const middleware = [promiseMiddleware, ...defaultMiddlewares];

export const store = configureStore({ reducer, middleware });

/**
 * somewhere in the /src
 * saga usage example with trackWorker
 */
function getPlanets() {
  return {
    type: 'GET_PLANETS',
    payload: fetch('planets')
  };
}
```

### Connecting the dots

For everything to work at the same time, you need to use all the previous steps.

```javascript
import { configureStore, getDefaultMiddleware } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import {
  promiseMiddleware,
  toolkitMiddleware,
  trackWorker
} from 'redux-pending-effects';
import createSagaMiddleware from '@redux-saga/core';
import { call, put, takeEvery } from '@redux-saga/core/effects';
import { rootReducer as reducer } from './root.reducer';
import { rootSaga } from './root.saga';

const defaultMiddlewares = getDefaultMiddleware();
const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware();
const middleware = [
  promiseMiddleware,
  toolkitMiddleware,
  sagaMiddleware,
  ...defaultMiddlewares
];

export const store = configureStore({ reducer, middleware });

sagaMiddleware.run(rootSaga);

/**
 * somewhere in the /src
 * saga usage example with trackWorker
 */
function* getPlanets() {
  yield takeEvery(getPlanetsRequest.type, trackWorker(handleGetPlanets));
}

function* handleGetPlanets() {
  const planets = yield call(Api.getPlanets);
  yield put(getPlanetsCompleted(planets));
}
```

### Selector

Just a regular usage of redux selectors

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { selectIsPending } from 'redux-pending-effects';

import { YourApplication } from './YourApplication';
import { AppLoader } from './App.loader';

export const App = () => {
  const isPending = useSelector(selectIsPending);

  return isPending ? <AppLoader /> : <YourApplication />;
};
```

### References

I find these packages useful and similar to this one. So, it's important to mention them here.

- [redux-pending](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-pending)
- [redux-pender](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-pender)
- [redux-promise-middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-promise-middleware)

The main reason why I didn't choose them: they do one thing, and it's impossible to add something second to them.
